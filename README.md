# Trenches Core
The heart of The Trenches App—AI agents digging alpha from the blockchain mud. Built by Ryn Voss | The Trench Commander.

## What’s This?
- AI agents sniffing out whale moves, scams, and gems.  
- On-chain data crunching (ETH, SOL, etc.).  
- Open-source chaos for the crypto trenches.

## Status
- Early alpha—expect bugs, not moon Lambos (yet).  
- Docs coming when Ryn stops tweaking at 3 AM.
